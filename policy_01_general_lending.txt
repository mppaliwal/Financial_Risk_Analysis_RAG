**Credit Policy Document: General Lending Guidelines (Version 2.3)**

**Section 1: Eligibility Criteria**
1.1 Minimum Credit Score: All applicants must have a FICO score of 680 or higher for standard unsecured loans. For secured loans, a minimum score of 650 is acceptable provided adequate collateral is presented.
1.2 Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: The maximum acceptable DTI is 40% for unsecured loans. For secured loans, the maximum DTI is 45%. This ratio includes all existing debt payments plus the proposed new loan's monthly obligation. Any DTI exceeding these limits requires an exception.
1.3 Employment Stability: Applicants are generally required to demonstrate at least 2 years of continuous employment with the same employer or in a highly stable industry. Recent job changes (within the last 6 months) require additional verification, including a letter from the new employer and proof of stable income for at least 3 months.

**Section 2: Loan Purpose and Risk Assessment**
2.1 Acceptable Loan Purposes: Loans are typically approved for established business expansion, home purchases and renovations, debt consolidation, and educational expenses.
2.2 High-Risk Loan Purposes: Loans for speculative investments (e.g., volatile stock market trading, cryptocurrency purchases), gambling, or highly uncertain startup ventures are strictly prohibited. Personal loans for luxury items exceeding 10% of annual income are also considered high risk and often declined without strong mitigating factors.
2.3 Income Verification: All stated income must be verifiable through official documents such as the latest two pay stubs, last two years' tax returns, or bank statements showing consistent deposits. Unverified income cannot be considered in the DTI calculation.

**Section 3: Documentation Requirements**
3.1 Mandatory Proof: Latest two pay stubs, last two years' tax returns, and a valid government-issued ID are mandatory for all applications.
